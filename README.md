1. HelloWorld implementation but change the text into some confusing contents. I made it into a small IQ quiz.
2. Add a listener to the button in the bottom right to appear a text and a button to show the answer of the quiz.
P.S. By reading the code of the general(normal) template I removed a function call named 'stringFromJNI()' which will change the original text into a given one from the library.
